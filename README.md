# Chinmay Dave

Hello ! Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio. I am an Aspiring Data Scientist and Mechnical Engineer from Gujarat Technological University, with a drive to earn a place and grow in the data science field. I have a deep interest in machine learning & NLP. I have some working experience in the data science field doing internship and various projects. 


# Education

# [(Project 3:) Credit card fraud detection using Machine Learning](https://github.com/daverx390dc/Credit-card-fraud-detection)
![](/images/creditcards450.jpg)
  

* Making a model that detects fraudulent transaction of a credit card. 

*SKILLS : Pandas, Numpy,sklearn, Exploratory data analysis , Feature Engineering and selection, KNN, Logistic regression, Model evaluation using Accuracy
score, F1 score, precision and recall. Data Visualization through seaborn.

* Applied some ml models, did statistical analysis. After that Random Forest was found out to be the best-fit model
