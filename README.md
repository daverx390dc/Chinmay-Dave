Data Science Portfolio

Hello ! Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio. I am an Aspiring Data Scientist and Mechnical Engineer from Gujarat Technological University, with a drive to earn a place and grow in the data science field. I have a deep interest in machine learning & NLP. I have some working experience in the data science field doing internship and various projects. 


# Education
* B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering), Gujarat Technological University (Ahmedabad)

# Projects

Some of my work is still in progress. Iâ€™ve been working on those. You can check out some of the other projects below.

* Making a model that detects fraudulent transaction of a credit card. 

*SKILLS : Pandas, Numpy,sklearn, Exploratory data analysis , Feature Engineering and selection, KNN, Logistic regression, Model evaluation using Accuracy
score, F1 score, precision and recall. Data Visualization through seaborn.

* Applied some ml models, did statistical analysis. After that Random Forest was found out to be the best-fit model
