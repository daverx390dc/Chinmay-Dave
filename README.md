Data Science Portfolio

Hello ! Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio. I am an Aspiring Data Scientist and Mechnical Engineer from Gujarat Technological University, with a drive to earn a place and grow in the data science field. I have a deep interest in machine learning & NLP. I have some working experience in the data science field doing internship and various projects. 


# Education
* B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering), Gujarat Technological University (Ahmedabad)

# Projects

Some of my work is still in progress. I’ve been working on those. You can check out some of the other projects below.

* Collected ***S&P stock*** history data from **tiingo(financial data platform)** using free api key.

* Analysed the effect of **GAFAM** on **S&P stock**, used graphical representation.

* Applied some ml models, did statistical analysis. After that **LSTM** was found out to be the best-fit model

* Used **SMILES** notation to compute **Lipinski’s descriptors**, collected the data from **ChEMBLdatabase**.

* Performed exploratory Data Analysis, computed molecular descriptors using **PADELDescriptors software** & prepared (X, Y) data frames.

* Applied **Random Forest Algorithm** & for better understanding of accuracy level, plotted a graph using **matplotlib library**.

* TMDB dataset of 5000 Movies is collected from **kaggle** and basic **EDA** is performed. 

* Tags are made out of overview, genres, keywords, cast and crew data of movies and **stemming** is done.

* **Count Vectorization** is applied and similar movies are obtained based on **Cosine Similarity**.


# [(Project 4: Data Analytics) Sales Insight Data Analysis Project in Power-BI.](https://github.com/koustav149/-Sales-Insight-Data-Analysis-Project-in-Power-BI.)

* Analysed the **Aims Grid** approach & checked market-related information from particular **SQL database**.

* Plugged **mysql database** ,with **Power-BI** & did **data wrangling** & currency normalization.

* Built **Power-BI** dashboard. Created a mobile view of that & access it inside the Power-BI application.

# [(Project 5: Sports Analytics) IPL Players Analysis (2008-2019)](https://ipldataanalysis.herokuapp.com/)

* IPL ball by ball and matches dataset is collected from **kaggle** and basic **EDA** is performed. 

* Team wise and player wise analysis done for year 2008-2019.

* **Visualizations** are made using **matplotlib**, **seaborn** and **plotly** libraries.

# [(Project 6: Google Data Analyst Capstone Project) Cyclistic Bike-share Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/koustav149/Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project)

* Previous 12 months datasets are downloaded and merged. **Data Cleaning** is done, datas are validated and **outliers** are removed. 

* Visualizations are done to find out how two types of users(member and casual) uses cyclistic bike share's bike differently.
